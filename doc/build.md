# Build

## Work with the local version

* Clone the "InvoicesApp" repository on GitHub (https://github.com/BananaAccounting/InvoicesApp).
* Open the "CMakeLists.txt" project with QtCreator, the file is under InvoicesApp->src.
* Build the project.
* Install in Banana the .sbaa file generated by the build, the file can be found under InvoicesApp->src.
* If you already have a online version of the Invoice App installed, you have to disable it (wihtout disinstall it, it would be automatically re-installed).

### Notes
If you works on InvoicesApp is better to use the internal version of Banana to visualize all the options.
